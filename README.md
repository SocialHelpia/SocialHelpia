# SocialHelpia
At Social Helpia, our focus is to work in accordance with our goals and objectives in our corporate strategy,  “Let’s work together to make life better of the poor family”.  Our vision is to ease the suffering of the Ummah by dealing with the following problems:  1. Reducing poverty, which is an outrage against humanity as it robs people of their dignity, freedom and hope of power over their own lives. 2. Providing education for all, so that people can live an independent and respectful life. 3. Provision of the basic amenities for those in need; in order to create a world where charity and compassion produce justice, self-reliance and human development.
